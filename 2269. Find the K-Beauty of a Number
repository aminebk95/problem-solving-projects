The k-beauty of an integer num is defined as the number of substrings of num when it is read as a string that meet the following conditions:

It has a length of k.
It is a divisor of num.
Given integers num and k, return the k-beauty of num.

Note:

Leading zeros are allowed.
0 is not a divisor of any value.
A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.
