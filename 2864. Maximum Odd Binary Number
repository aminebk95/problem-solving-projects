You are given a binary string s that contains at least one '1'.

You have to rearrange the bits in such a way that the resulting binary number is the maximum odd binary number that can be created from this combination.

Return a string representing the maximum odd binary number that can be created from the given combination.

Note that the resulting string can have leading zeros.

class Solution:
    def maximumOddBinaryNumber(self, s: str) -> str:
        l=[]
        ch=""
        for i in s:
            l.append(int(i))
        l=sorted(l, reverse=True)
        if(l[0]==0):
            return s
        for i in range(1,len(l)):
            ch=ch+str(l[i])
        ch=ch+"1"
        return ch
