You are given a positive integer n. Each digit of n has a sign according to the following rules:

The most significant digit is assigned a positive sign.
Each other digit has an opposite sign to its adjacent digits.
Return the sum of all digits with their corresponding sign.
int alternateDigitSum(int n) {
    int i=n,signe,nb=0,s=0;
    while(i){
        i=i/10;
        nb++;
    }
    if(nb%2==0)
        signe=-1;
    else
        signe=1;
    while(n){
        s=s+(n%10)*signe;
        n=n/10;
        signe=signe*(-1);
    }
    return s;
}
